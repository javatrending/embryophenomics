## What is embryo-phenomics?
Embryo-phenomics is a technological platform for studying the phenome of aquatic embryos. Embryonic development is the most dynamic period of an organisms' life - temporally, functionally and spatially. Embryo-phenomics consists of two pieces of high-throughput technology - bioimaging hardware ["OpenVIM"](www.openvim.org) and analytical software ["EmbryoCV"](www.embryocv.org). These technologies are synergistic and enable the visualisation and quantification of the dynamic process of whole-organism development with high temporal accuracy, in large numbers of embryos all while finely controlling the embryonic environment. The embryo-phenomics platform is automated and so can run over prolonged periods without any need for manual interaction and is therefore ideal for capturing the process of embryonic development which, while dynamic, also occurs over the course of hours and days.

### How applicable is embryo-phenomics to me?
Both the OpenVIM hardware and EmbryoCV software are freely available for others to use and adapt to their own needs. Both of these technologies have been developed to be modular and highly versatile. 

OpenVIM has been used with a range of organisms from single celled Protozoa, various molluscan and amphipod embryos, through to early life stage planktonic jellyfish. The components are modular meaning that lenses ranging from 20 X - 5000 X digital magnification have all been used succesfully. Experiments ranging from just a few hours through to many months have been performed and the number of embryos within experiments have ranged from just a single embryo through to 384 per OpenVIM system. Furthermore OpenVIM uses the open-source MicroManager software and therefore any components supported by MicroManager can be used with OpenVIM.

EmbryoCV is a software written in Python which has become a popular language among biologists. Furthermore, the majority of the image processing done in EmbryoCV uses the OpenCV computer vision library and its underlying code is written in C. Most of the processes in EmbryoCV are applicable to different species and it has been tested with both a freshwater gastropod and a marine amphipod - two species that possess very different forms of development and challenges in terms of their appearance. Nonetheless EmbryoCV was effective with both.
